Step-23
when i=10
i<5 then output giving false
if i>5 then output giving true
 
i<=5 then false
i<=10 then true
i>=10 then true

if (condition)  statement;
if (i<5)
   System.out.println("i is less than 5")

i=4
if (i<5)
   System.out.println("i is less than 5")
output= i is less than 5

int number1=5;
int number2=7;
if (number2>number1)
system.out.println("number2 is greater than number1")
output= number2 is greater than number1
if condition is wrong so nothing is printed
